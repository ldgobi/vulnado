To address the remark for [Line 13], we need to handle the empty method `contextLoads`. According to the SonarQube suggestion, we can either add a nested comment explaining why the method is empty, throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`, or complete the implementation. Since this is a test method, it is common to leave it empty if its purpose is to verify that the application context loads without issues. Adding a comment explaining this is the most appropriate solution.

### ContentEditor Changes:
```json
ContentEditor({
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 14,
      "content": "        // This test method is intentionally left empty to verify that the application context loads successfully."
    }
  ]
})
```
