To address the remark for line [13], we need to handle the empty method `contextLoads`. According to the SonarQube suggestion, we can either:

1. Add a nested comment explaining why the method is empty.
2. Throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
3. Complete the implementation.

Since this is a test method and is likely intended to verify that the application context loads without issues, the best approach is to add a comment explaining why the method is empty. This will clarify the purpose of the method and satisfy the SonarQube remark.

Here is the fix:

```java
@Test
public void contextLoads() {
    // This test ensures that the Spring application context loads successfully.
}
```

### ContentEditor Changes:
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 14,
      "content": "    // This test ensures that the Spring application context loads successfully."
    }
  ]
}
```
