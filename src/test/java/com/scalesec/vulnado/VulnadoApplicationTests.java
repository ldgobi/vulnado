To address the remark for [Line 13], we need to handle the empty method `contextLoads`. According to the SonarQube suggestion, we can either add a nested comment explaining why the method is empty, throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`, or complete the implementation. Since this is a test method, adding a comment explaining its purpose is the most appropriate solution.

### Resolution
We will add a comment explaining why the method is empty.

### ContentEditor Operations
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "INSERT",
      "lineNumber": 14,
      "content": "// This test method is intentionally left empty to verify the application context loads successfully."
    }
  ]
}
```
