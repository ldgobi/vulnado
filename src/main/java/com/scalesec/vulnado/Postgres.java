Let's address the remarks one by one, starting with the first remark at line 12.

### **Remark Analysis for Line 12**
- **[ISSUE](java:S1118)**: Add a private constructor to hide the implicit public one.

The `Postgres` class is a utility class with only static methods. To prevent instantiation, we need to add a private constructor.

---

### **Code Fix for Line 12**
We will add a private constructor to the `Postgres` class to prevent instantiation.

```java
private Postgres() {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Utility class");
}
```
