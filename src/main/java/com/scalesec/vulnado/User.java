Let's address the remarks one by one, starting with [7] and [8].

### Remarks for [7] and [8]:
- **[ISSUE](java:S1128)**: Remove unused imports `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser` and `io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm`.

These imports are not used anywhere in the code, so they can be safely removed.

### ContentEditor Operations:
