Let's address the remarks one by one and provide the necessary fixes.

---

### **[6]:**
- **[ISSUE](java:S1118):** Add a private constructor to hide the implicit public one.

The `Cowsay` class is a utility class, and it should not be instantiated. To fix this, we will add a private constructor to prevent instantiation.

---

### **[10]:**
- **[ISSUE](java:S106):** Replace this use of `System.out` by a logger.

We will replace the `System.out.println` statement with a proper logger. Since no logger is currently declared, we will add one.

---

### **[11]:**
- **[HOTSPOT](javasecurity:S6350):** Make sure that this user-controlled command argument doesn't lead to unwanted behavior.
- **[HOTSPOT](java:S4036):** Make sure the "PATH" used to find this command includes only what you intend.

The command execution is vulnerable to command injection because the `input` is directly concatenated into the command string. To fix this:
1. We will sanitize the `input` to prevent command injection.
2. We will ensure that the `PATH` used to find the command is controlled and does not include unintended directories.

---

### **[24]:**
- **[HOTSPOT](java:S4507):** Make sure this debug feature is deactivated before delivering the code in production.

The `e.printStackTrace()` is a debug feature and should not be used in production. We will replace it with proper logging of the exception.

---

### **Code Fixes**

Here are the changes we will make to address the issues:

1. Add a private constructor to the `Cowsay` class.
2. Replace `System.out.println` with a logger.
3. Sanitize the `input` to prevent command injection.
4. Ensure the `PATH` is controlled.
5. Replace `e.printStackTrace()` with proper logging.

### **Updated Code**

```java
package com.scalesec.vulnado;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Cowsay {
  private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(Cowsay.class.getName());

  private Cowsay() {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
  }

  public static String run(String input) {
    ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder();

    // Sanitize input to prevent command injection
    String sanitizedInput = input.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", "");

    // Ensure controlled PATH
    processBuilder.environment().put("PATH", "/usr/games");

    String cmd = "/usr/games/cowsay '" + sanitizedInput + "'";
    LOGGER.info("Executing command: " + cmd);

    processBuilder.command("bash", "-c", cmd);

    StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();

    try {
      Process process = processBuilder.start();
      BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));

      String line;
      while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        output.append(line).append("\n");
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
      LOGGER.severe("An error occurred while executing the command: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    return output.toString();
  }
}
```

### **Explanation of Fixes**

1. **Private Constructor**:
   - Added a private constructor to prevent instantiation of the `Cowsay` class.

2. **Logger**:
   - Replaced `System.out.println` with `LOGGER.info` for logging the command being executed.
   - Added `LOGGER.severe` to log exceptions instead of using `e.printStackTrace()`.

3. **Sanitization**:
   - Sanitized the `input` by removing all characters except alphanumeric and spaces using `input.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", "")`.

4. **Controlled PATH**:
   - Explicitly set the `PATH` environment variable to `/usr/games` to ensure only the intended directory is used.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Replaced `e.printStackTrace()` with proper logging of the exception message.
