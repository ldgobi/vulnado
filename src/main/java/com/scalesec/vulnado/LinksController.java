To address the remarks provided by SonarQube, we will analyze and fix each issue step by step. Let's start with the unused imports and then address the security hotspot remarks.

### Fixing the Issues

#### [3]: Remove unused import 'org.springframework.boot'
The import `org.springframework.boot.*` is not used in the code. We will remove it.

#### [4]: Remove unused import 'org.springframework.http.HttpStatus'
The import `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus` is not used in the code. We will remove it.

#### [8]: Remove unused import 'java.io.Serializable'
The import `java.io.Serializable` is not used in the code. We will remove it.

#### [15] and [19]: Security Hotspot (java:S3752)
The `@RequestMapping` annotations on lines 15 and 19 allow both safe and unsafe HTTP methods by default. To address this, we will explicitly specify the allowed HTTP methods (`GET` in this case) to ensure safety.

### ContentEditor Changes

Here are the changes to be made:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 15,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 19,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links-v2\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Unused Imports**:
   - Removed the unused imports on lines 3, 4, and 8 to clean up the code and avoid unnecessary clutter.

2. **Security Hotspot**:
   - Updated the `@RequestMapping` annotations on lines 15 and 19 to explicitly allow only the `GET` HTTP method. This ensures that unsafe methods like `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` are not inadvertently allowed.

These changes ensure the code is cleaner and adheres to security best practices.
