To address the remarks provided by SonarQube, we will analyze and fix each issue step by step.

### Fix for [3] and [4]
Both lines contain unused imports (`org.springframework.boot.*` and `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`). These imports should be removed.

### Fix for [8]
The import `java.io.Serializable` is unused and should also be removed.

### Fix for [15] and [19]
Both lines involve a security hotspot (`java:S3752`) regarding the use of HTTP methods. We need to ensure that allowing safe and unsafe HTTP methods is secure. To address this, we will explicitly specify the allowed HTTP methods (`GET` in this case) for the endpoints.

### ContentEditor Fixes
Here are the changes to be made:

```json
ContentEditor({
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 15,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 19,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links-v2\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    }
  ]
})
``` 

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Unused Imports**: Lines 3, 4, and 8 are removed because the imports are not used anywhere in the code.
2. **Security Hotspot**: Lines 15 and 19 are updated to explicitly specify the HTTP method (`GET`) for the endpoints. This ensures that only safe HTTP methods are allowed, addressing the security concern.

After applying these changes, the code will be cleaner and more secure.
