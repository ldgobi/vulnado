To address the remarks provided by SonarQube, we will analyze and fix each issue or hotspot step by step.

---

### Fix for [3] and [4]
- **Remark**: Remove unused imports `org.springframework.boot.*` and `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`.
- **Resolution**: These imports are not used anywhere in the code. We will delete them.

---

### Fix for [8]
- **Remark**: Remove unused import `java.io.Serializable`.
- **Resolution**: This import is not used anywhere in the code. We will delete it.

---

### Fix for [15] and [19]
- **Remark**: Ensure allowing safe and unsafe HTTP methods is safe here.
- **Resolution**: The `@RequestMapping` annotation allows all HTTP methods by default. To address this hotspot, we will explicitly restrict the HTTP methods to safe ones (`GET`) for both endpoints.

### ContentEditor Operations
Here are the operations to fix the issues:

```json
ContentEditor({
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 15,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 19,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links-v2\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    }
  ]
})
``` 

---

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Unused Imports**:
   - Removed `org.springframework.boot.*`, `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`, and `java.io.Serializable` as they are not used in the code.

2. **HTTP Method Restriction**:
   - Updated the `@RequestMapping` annotations for `/links` and `/links-v2` endpoints to explicitly allow only the `GET` method. This ensures that unsafe HTTP methods (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) are not allowed, addressing the security hotspot.
