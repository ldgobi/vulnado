### Analysis of Remarks

#### [6]: 
- **[ISSUE](java:S1128)**: The import `java.io.Serializable` is unused and should be removed to clean up the code.

#### [11]: 
- **[HOTSPOT](java:S3752)**: The HTTP method is not explicitly defined in the `@RequestMapping` annotation, which allows both safe (e.g., GET) and unsafe (e.g., POST) methods. This could lead to security vulnerabilities. Explicitly define the HTTP method to ensure safe usage.

---

### Fixes

#### [6]: Remove the unused import `java.io.Serializable`.

#### [11]: Explicitly define the HTTP method in the `@RequestMapping` annotation to ensure safe usage. For this case, `GET` is appropriate since the method retrieves data without modifying server-side state.
