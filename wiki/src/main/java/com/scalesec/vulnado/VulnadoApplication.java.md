# Documentation: `VulnadoApplication.java`

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with key Spring Boot annotations to enable automatic configuration and scanning of servlet components. The application also includes a setup step for a PostgreSQL database before starting the Spring Boot application context.

## Class: `VulnadoApplication`

### Annotations
- **`@SpringBootApplication`**: 
  - Combines the functionality of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
  - Marks this class as the primary configuration class for the Spring Boot application.
- **`@ServletComponentScan`**: 
  - Enables scanning for servlet components (e.g., `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, `@WebListener`) within the application.

### Methods
#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Acts as the main entry point for the Java application.
  - Initializes the PostgreSQL database setup and starts the Spring Boot application.
- **Steps**:
  1. **`Postgres.setup()`**: 
     - A static method call to set up the PostgreSQL database. This likely involves initializing database connections, creating schemas, or performing other preparatory tasks.
  2. **`SpringApplication.run(VulnadoApplication.class, args)`**: 
     - Launches the Spring Boot application by creating an application context and starting the embedded server.

## Insights
- **Database Initialization**: 
  - The explicit call to `Postgres.setup()` indicates that the application requires a PostgreSQL database to be initialized before the Spring Boot context is fully started. This suggests a dependency on database readiness for the application to function correctly.
  
- **Servlet Component Scanning**: 
  - The use of `@ServletComponentScan` implies that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners that need to be registered with the embedded servlet container.

- **Spring Boot Framework**: 
  - The application leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency injection features, simplifying the setup and reducing boilerplate code.

- **Modular Design**: 
  - The separation of database setup into a dedicated `Postgres` class suggests a modular design approach, where database-related logic is encapsulated outside the main application class.

## Dependencies
- **Spring Boot**: 
  - Provides the core framework for building and running the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: 
  - The application depends on a PostgreSQL database, as indicated by the `Postgres.setup()` method call.
